## Binary Loan Eligibility Model with Different Machine Learning Algorithms

Often many people think that Neural Network models are so much better than other models algorithms, but in some cases, this is not true, because a Neural Network consumes a lot of memory and the training time is quiet big. So, there are better Machine Learning Algorithms to choose from, that are more light, with a short Training Time, and can achieve the same Accuracy, Recall and Precision as a Neural Network Model.

The Machine Learning Algorithms that was used for the Loan Eligibility Dataset are:
- `Neural Network`
- `Logistic Regression`
- `Naive Bayes`
- `SVM`

Overall, the Logistic Regression and SVM Model, performs almost the same as the Neural Network Model, where the Logistic Regression Model achieve an Accuracy of 81%, the SVM Model 82%, and the Neural Network 82%.
